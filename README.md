# Corburt

Corburt Lite is in development and might be released this year (2023).

## About

### General

Corburt is a pretty simple text-based RPG game developed based on the ideas of *SimpleMUD*. The original codebase for SimpleMUD was written in C++ by Ron Penton, the author of MUD Game Programming book.

Inspirations come from a game called [93 Realms](https://windows93.net:8083/), which my friends and I had a great time playing.

### Lite Dev

**Important notes**: Corburt will undergo a huge overhaul in these versions, so a lot of the original content will be removed. Currently, there are no enemies or items in game, but please do not worry. They will be added back when their update is complete.

Items marked by "ðŸ”¸" are implemented but untested.

## Features/Highlights

- **Written in plain C code** (C99).
- **Multi-platform support**: expected to work properly on Windows, Linux, MacOS and several other \*nixes.
- **No external dependencies** (hopefully).
- **Open source**.
- **Easy to compile**: only two .c files, all other files are headers. friendly for C amateurs.

## Limitations

Please mind that Corburt is a game that -
- is in an **early stage of development**.
- might **not** be finished.
- might **not** work properly on non-Windows platforms.
- **won't** receive updates frequently enough to implement all improvements and bug fixes. 

## Requirements

### Compiling

- Corburt relies on system-specific headers and haven't been ported to systems other than Windows and POSIX. POSIX support is implemented but not tested, and bugs might still present.
- It is recommended to use GCC compiler, and especially recommended to use Code::Blocks to compile. I myself am using Code::Blocks to develop Corburt and would provide project files along with the source.
- It is also applicable to simply `make cbinput` and `make corburt` on *nixes.

### Performance

- **System Resources**
  - Corburt is a lightspeed and lightweight game that doesn't require much resources. It should be able to work properly on even very old computers.
    - Please note that Corburt is a game that relies on disk I/O. Running Corburt while disk I/O is occupied (for example, when you are copying, compressing or extracting files) is not recommended because it is likely to ruin your game experience.
- **Graphics**
  - Corburt is designed to run in PC's console terminals with no less than 64 columns. Fixed-width-character output (which should be the case on most terminals) is necessary, otherwise the game would look "broken".
  - It is recommended to use black as default background color and white as foreground. Having white background is also okay (which is tested on MacOS's terminal), but it is not recommended to have any other color as background.

## How to

### Compile and Launch Corburt
- Please compile `cbinput.c` and `corburt.c` separately into 2 binary/executable files.
  - `cb.dat`,  `cbinput` and `corburt` should all be under the same directory.
  - Try `make cbinput` and then `make corburt` on *nix terminals. 
- Then run the two programs simultaneously. Open `cbinput` **first**, and **then** open `corburt`. On systems like MacOS, opening `corburt` before `cbinput` launches causes the main game to lose input from `cbinput`.
- Send your input at `cbinput` and the main Corburt program should be able to receive and process it.
- Please do not run two or more instances of `corburt`  simultaneously. That might cause unwanted consequences, i.e. destroy your save file.
- If you encounter problems, please report.

### Port Corburt to Other Platforms
- It shouldn't be hard for Corburt to be ported to other platforms as long as they support C99. Currently, there are only two files that rely on OS-specific headers. One is `cbcurses.h` and the other is `cbsys.h`.
  - However, Corburt opens and reads/writes one single file with two programs simultaneously. This **might** not work on certain systems.
- Generally, Corburt is expected to work on Windows, Linux, Mac and many other \*nixes. If that's not the case, please report.

## Report

If you are not sure what kind of report you are sending, or if your report contains more than one of the following types at the same time, you may just simply state "**Report**".

Will your report be seen? Very probably...

- I may not have time to review your report and your content may be ignored.
- Also, if the advice isn't given in a language I can use, or it's clearly incomplete, or I don't know how to implement it, I'll ignore it. Please use English when possible.
- Even if I like your suggestion a lot, I might not be able to implement it if it's too difficult to implement due to my very limited programming ability or time.
- Since I'm busy, if I can't or don't plan to implement a suggestion, I might just ignore it or close it.

### Bug Report

**When reporting bugs (if you came across any), please clarify:**

- What's the version of Corburt?
  - If it is not the latest version, test on the latest version.
- If you compiled Corburt yourself, what compiler are you using?
  - If you're using compilers that don't support C99, I might just ignore you.
  - Btw, GCC doesn't actually **totally** support C99.
- What had you done before the bug occurred?
  - You can copy & paste your input history from the `cbinput` window.
- Were there any error messages?
- Were any error log files generated?
- Did the game crash?

### Typo Report

**Please report if you find typos or grammar mistakes** in game or in this document.

### Balancing Feedback

If you find an unbalanced design in **the latest version of Corburt** and **a) it's not a joke or a trap**, and **b) it's adversely affecting gameplay**, please report it.

If you wish to add new content, see "**Suggestions**".

- **When giving a balancing feedback, please**
  - make sure you are very familiar with what you are proposing to modify.
  - make sure that what you propose to amend will not be offensive to others.
  - explain what you think is bad in the original design.
    - e.g. *"The difficulty of the new area does not match with the stated threat level."*
  - [optional, but suggested] explain how you think it would improve the game experience.
    - e.g. *"It will ease the difficulty curve."*
  - provide detailed alternatives or suggested modifications.
    - e.g. *"$400 is a little too much, make it $250."*
- **Examples of what you are welcome to suggest include:**
  - increase the cost of items to prevent abuse.
  - increase enemy experience drops when leveling up is unnecessarily difficult.
  - adjust bosses' difficulty to suit most players.

### Suggestions

This mainly refers to suggestions for new content. If it is an adjustment to existing content, see "**Balancing feedback**".

- What you should think carefully before suggesting include:
  - Major changes to the map
  - New mechanisms
  - Any web- or multiplayer-related content
